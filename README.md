# Machine Learning (Coursera)

This repo is a pool of assignments and related works from the Machine Learning course offered by Coursera.

I'm currently at the start of **[Week 6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/6)** (*17-Feb-20*)

This is the course taught at Stanford by Andrew Ng as CS229. Coursera's version is quiet old and watered-down judging by the [syllabus of current CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html).  The "real" CS229 [lies here](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229).
